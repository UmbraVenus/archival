130508,,Standing nude woman holding upside-down parasol,"The image for this drawing is black-and-white. A woman stands facing away from the viewer and slightly toward the right. Her hair is up in a bun, her face looks downward, and her shoulders are a bit slouched. Her right arm is bent, her elbow resting against her hip. In her arm she holds the handle of an upside-down parasol. The parasol is significantly less detailed than the woman. Its handle is a simple dark line, and its top part is a wide oval. Whistler’s “butterfly” signature is written on the right side of the parasol.",https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:47981_dynmc

She is slender, with her hair tied up. In the central, most detailed sketch, the woman stands facing the viewer, bending at the hip to touch her knees. In the top right she stands on tiptoe with her hands above her head, facing away from the viewer. At bottom right she looks back over her shoulder and crosses her arms over her chest.

A few small groups of people are scattered in on the right side of the field and on its back perimeter. One figure on the right has a round red shape suggesting a parasol.

132161,,Painting of head and torso of young figure,"A figure faces the viewer, looking slightly upward and to the left. They appear young and androgynous, with shoulder-length brown hair, thick eyebrows, large brown eyes, pink cheeks, red lips, and a prominent chin. The figure wears a purple garment. Because of the painting style and some possible pigment discoloration, it is difficult to see the details of the figure’s clothing. They also wear a small black hat with a large red feather attached diagonally across the front. The background behind them is dark green.",https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:62137_dynmc

479052,,A two-handled bowl seen from below which is decorated with two large eyes.,"A red bowl decorated with two large white eyes, with black used to indicate the eyebrows, nose and the iris of the eye.  There is also a teardrop shape on the forehead between the eyebrows.  On either side of the eyes are black nude figures with their arms and legs bent as if they are dancing.  Past those nude figures there are two looped handles which are also painted black.  The bowl has a fluted stem and a flat base, and the stem is hollow, opening up a round hole in the base.",https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:764516

The dancer in front wears a garland of red flowers around the waist and in hair, her arm is straight out form her waist while her right arm is bent with hand to neck. The dancer behind her poses on one pointed toe and holds a small bouquet of red flowers in her right hand with arms upraised. There’s the suggestion of a third dancer’s elbow and a man in top hat behind her on the right. The background is loose marks of golds and green.",https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:51640_dynmc

The kimono, tied in the back, flows around her running legs. Her face is fair and delicate, her black hair is combed back and tied up into a bun. The rain is depicted with heavy diagonal strokes of black ink pouring from a dark cloud in the upper right, with two angular lightning bolts flashing from the sky.",https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:767143

She arches her back slightly, leaning right, her head and neck turned to the right. Her other hand is out of the kimono and holding a long, bended piece of paper with writing on it. Part of an old tree trunk is suggested on the right, with white blooming flowers above. Clusters of yellow water irises emerge from the water, their leaves arching open, as if repeating the woman’s pose.

11208,,A large round green-gray jar decorated with dark flowing lines in a floral pattern,"From its flat circular base, the jar widens gradually up until the top third. There, it quickly curves back inward toward the center where a wide opening is ringed by a ridged cuff. With subtle horizontal striations across its surface, it is glazed in a muted green-gray, with decorative lines in dark olive. The top third shows a border featuring curving a geometric design. In a broad band across most of the side, a floral design of leaves and stems in flowing lines is set off by dark spaces, and a more narrow border at the bottom features a repeating leaf shape.",https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:38486_dynmc

21956,,Still life of pink and white roses fill a decorative Chinese vase.,"A vase is placed right of center as the garden roses and leaves hang over the vase, filling the empty space on the left. Seven full roses are seen in various angles and stages of bloom from opening bud to an aging bloom. The large cylindrical vase is detailed with warriors galloping on white horses and swords out, against a brown background. The vase sits on a shiny wooden table, its reflection is seen in the varnish, as well as the wood grain. The background behind the vase is undescribed hues of blues and greens.",https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:62098_dynmc

35636,recto,A drawing of a seated woman spinning thread.,"The drawing in graphite on white paper depicts a woman seated center-page facing the viewer; her head turned to the right in profile. She wears a plain sleeveless dress gathered at the shoulders with circular brooches. To the right of the page is a spinning mechanism: a tall ornamental column topped with a narrow dowel. She guides thread from a mass of fibers at the top of the dowel with her left hand. The thread crosses her torso into her right hand, where she turns it onto a spool. There is written script at the bottom center of the page.",https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:75978_dynmc
